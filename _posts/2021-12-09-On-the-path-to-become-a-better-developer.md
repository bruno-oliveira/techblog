There are many books and blog posts and youtube videos detailing how you can advance in your career and become a better developer. Typically, advancing in your career means aiming for and reaching positions like Senior Software Engineer or Staff Software Engineer and, usually, getting to those positions, implies that, at some extent, and some point in time, you must already be performing at the required level while still being one level below the target.

Since I am a medior developer for a while now, who has worked in quite a few companies, worked with many people both more senior than me as well as of similar level and also more junior, I think I am at the best position to write about what I have been doing myself in order to become a better developer and grow into more senior roles, and also, what I've read and seen other people do that makes them distinguished as a more senior developer.
