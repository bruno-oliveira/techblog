title: On the path to become a better developer

There are many books and blog posts and youtube videos detailing how you can advance in your career and become a better developer. Typically, advancing in your career means aiming for and reaching positions like Senior Software Engineer or Staff Software Engineer and, usually, getting to those positions, implies that, at some extent, and some point in time, you must already be performing at the required level while still being one level below the target.

Since I am a medior developer for a while now, who has worked in quite a few companies, worked with many people both more senior than me as well as of similar level and also more junior, I think I am at the best position to write about what I have been doing myself in order to become a better developer and grow into more senior roles, and also, what I've read and seen other people do that makes them distinguished as a more senior developer.

### Have great habits

As with many things, this one is quite obvious: if you want to improve, start by having great habits and encouraging other members of your team to follow you and foster such habits. Usually, these can be very small things that, when done consistently, can raise the bar for the quality of your work and the standards with which you will evaluate others' work. Examples of such habits can be:

- follow the boyscout rule: whenever possible, do marginal improvements in the codebase. Sometimes, simply refactoring a method into separate ones with more descriptive names cam go a long way. Clean up dead code, add unit tests when/during fixing a bug. Leverage IDE linters: IntelliJ is great at pointing duplication, long methods, redundant calls and at making it trivial to refactor methods. Learn how to leverage these and spread the knowledge across your team;

- keep an eye on operational things and raise alerts in relevant slack channels where and when needed: examples include for example, failed CI/CD pipelines for production releases, test coverage dropping, outages, etc. It's sometimes easy to ignore these things or wait for platform teams or others to raise the alarms, but, being proactive in either raising the issues with the right people or even working through them yourself is a great trait to have, and, again, leading by example is great since you can motivate others to do the same and gain relevant experience early;

### Writing documentation and structuring loose notes

Documentation is extremely underrated in general and it has quite a bad reputation.
