One recent tweet sparkled my interest and I decided to write a post about it. There's usually a lot of good content on Twitter that can motivate me to write and, this tweet definitely fits the bill:

The basic idea behind this tweet is an important one, especially nowadays, while new stacks keep appearing everywhere and new ways of doing old things are praised in deteriment of "older" stacks that are battle-tested, proven to work and have stood the test of time. With such a proliferation of what seems to be new technology (but, for the most part, is just a rehash and repackaging of the true foundational concepts that have remained largely unchanged over the years) it can feel daunting to be "left on the station" instead of jumping on the adoption bandwagon, but, what this tweet proposes instead and that I absolutely agree with is exactly the opposite: _there's no need to jump on the bandwagon, you haven't even taken the time to explore the station properly._

The concept of _exploring the station_ is even more relevant nowadays because it gives you depth within a certain tech stack, and, when you gain enough depth and expertise, you will be able to apply all the knowledge you have to tackle new problems by leveraging old tools and the real "need" to jump on the bandwagon will simply not be there anymore. Not because you don't want to, but, because you don't need to.

There is yet another aspect of deliberately not jumping on bandwagons that can only be experienced after a certain amount of time and that is the realization that you can _maximize_ your usage of a certain stack the longer you stick with it, which means that in the long run, _not_ chasing always the latest and shiny new technology will actually be beneficial for your career and knowledge retention. Deep and focused knowledge can be several times more powerful than the counterpart of shallow and diffuse knowledge.

### Importance of going deep and focused into a single area

Knowledge use and applicability is directly proportional to the depth and time invested in learning and retaining said knowledge: at the risk of oversimplifying too much, if you know how to write an "hello world" style program in 5 or 6 different langauges, you can claim to have a high breadth of knowledge: maybe you know a bit the differences between different build systems for different langauges, maybe you get a flavor for purely functional languages instead of object-oriented ones, but, in the end, all the bits and pieces of knowledge you retain are so shallow that they are basically not usable anywhere outside of the said context of an "hello world" program. If, by contrast, you know object-oriented concepts very well, if you know how and when to apply design patterns to refactor an OO program into reusable components that make it easier to test and refactor, than you have _deep knowledge_ and such knowledge is much more useful because it's transversal to the fundamentals of the craft which means that the number of situations where this knowledge can be applied is also much larger, and that makes it much more useful.

Part of the reason why this happens is that knowledge usage is cumulative over time, as we can observe in the chart below:
