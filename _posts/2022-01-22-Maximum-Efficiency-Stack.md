One recent tweet sparkled my interest and I decided to write a post about it. There's usually a lot of good content on Twitter that can motivate me to write and, this tweet definitely fits the bill:

The basic idea behind this tweet is an important one, especially nowadays, while new stacks keep appearing everywhere and new ways of doing old things are praised in deteriment of "older" stacks that are battle-tested, proven to work and have stood the test of time. With such a proliferation of what seems to be new technology (but, for the most part, is just a rehash and repackaging of the true foundational concepts that have remained largely unchanged over the years) it can feel daunting to be "left on the station" instead of jumping on the adoption bandwagon, but, what this tweet proposes instead and that I absolutely agree with is exactly the opposite: _there's no need to jump on the bandwagon, you haven't even taken the time to explore the station properly._
