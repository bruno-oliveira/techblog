One of the most underrated things in the industry, especially when you're working as a full-time developer, is the power of keeping a "knowledge stash" handy. There's this perception that knowledge comes through experience, time, or simply osmosis, and, while that can be true over a long enough period of time and for the more superficial knowledge, there are just too many layers in a professional codebase that it's impossible to grok it immediately.

Knowledge is often gained in sort of "understanding bursts": you work on a given area of the codebase to help fix a bug, or extending some functionality and you learn it, even if almost by a combination of intuition and pattern matching and your previous experiences, obviously. But, maybe we can do better. Maybe if we take some time and analyze the work we have just done, we can come to the realization that there are certain tasks that are particular of our team and company. Maybe we need a small script to give us access to some internal registries, maybe we need to configure the memory for our Docker daemon before attempting to run _that_ large test locally, etc, etc. These details can often feel overwhelming, and, unfortunately, there will be so many of such details that it's easy to get lost. So, follow Picard's project tips:
