Software development is all about writing code to solve real-world, concrete business problems with fuzzy domains, innovative solutions and constraints at several levels all while navigating office politics, tight deadlines, budgets and much more. It is not an easy task by any means. This is why, in many yearly plans, some companies allocate budget and time for fixing bugs and issues that arise during the day-to-day work and both development teams and org-wide stakeholders, like track managers, product owners and others see that reflected in the yearly plans by ensuring that some form of slack is present to account for the inevitable bugs and slips they might cause.

Part of the problem that can be seen as one of the root causes of these bugs _always_ popping up, is that, more often than not, the domain itself is not fully understood or there are some assumptions that aren't properly validated that can turn the implementation into a mess. 

Gaining understanding of the domain of the problem is not easy but it's required in order to be able to write the most efficient implementation possible. This is because, when you gain an understanding of the problem, that underlying understanding can be put into the code to create very clean and readable solutions. 

Great coding is less about knowing and using all the latest features of your language of choice and it's more about being able to use only the simplest and most effective constructs that allow you to express the deep understanding that you gained over the problem and the domain. 
Sometimes, this understanding will be possible to map directly into the code in standard ways: design patterns, a specific algorithm that's key to the problem domain, a simple if encoding specific business logic, etc.

In other cases, this understanding can't be directly mapped to a specific pattern but, it will be apparent in the high level structure of the code, i.e. it's classes, packages, modules. 

Discovering these underlying patterns in your domain and how they can exploited to simplify your work is an art and it's what several people would tell you that programming is all about. I agree with them, but, this definitely changes the traditional way of doing programming.
