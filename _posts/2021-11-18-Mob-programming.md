As a developer, at least once in a while, I bet you've experienced something like this: you get assigned a ticket at a beginning of the sprint, and, start working on it. It's a relatively self-contained and small ticket, should be wrapped up in about a week's time. You make good progress everyday, no real blockers, and, after 4 days of work, interspersed with meetings in between, you add your final tests, clean it up, and put it up for review. Thursday, 12h00. With some luck, you get your review feedback today, process it Friday morning, and right near the end of the day, you can merge it and slide into the weekend with a feeling of a job well done... Except... it's never like this, right?
