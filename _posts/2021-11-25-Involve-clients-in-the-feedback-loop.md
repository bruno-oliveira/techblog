One of the biggest struggles for any product-based company is to know exactly _what_ to build. What to build is really important because that's what ends up driving your business forward and it's also the only way to attract, and eventually retain customers. Then, word of mouth, will do a lot of the "marketing" in spreading the word and expand the influence of your product to prospective new customers and that's how part of the initial growth can happen.

However, almost paradoxically, after having the first solid customer base in place, something weird happens to most product based companies, especially as they scale up:

essentially, they stop talking to clients. Why is this happening?

Instead of having direct conversations with the customer, which is the most relevant stakeholder of all, we start introducing several proxies between the development team and the customer, which, just like the broken telephone game, will twist the concerns and expectations from both sides, and it usually ends up on having developers building the wrong thing, working in isolation from the customer, taking longer to deliver... just to learn after the fact that it was not really what was intended at all.

The problem with introducing these proxy stakeholders like Product Owners, Managers, Customer Relations, etc, is that the people in the middle are not tied directly to the product development directly, so, when translating the needs of the customer back to the development team, an obvious disconnect happens because the interface between both ends only knows about one side (the business and/ore requirements), but, is somewhat in the dark about the other side (the development team and its efforts) which makes interfacing literally impossible.

I think it would be very valuable if product based companies would bring back the practice that most likely they used originally of keeping in touch with customers directly, making them part of the feedback loop of the product development, because this is the most straightforward way of ensuring that what is being built is exactly what the customer will need, and, simultaneously, this can help shaping future efforts, so, a roadmap where the development team talks to the customers directly, will look very different of a roadmap that is developed in isolation by a product team where the only traces of customer communication come in the form of emails or messages exchanged between a product owner or a consultant and the customer themselves.
