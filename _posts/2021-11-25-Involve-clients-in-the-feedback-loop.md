One of the biggest struggles for any product-based company is to know exactly _what_ to build. What to build is really important because that's what ends up driving your business forward and it's also the only way to attract, and eventually retain customers. Then, word of mouth, will do a lot of the "marketing" in spreading the word and expand the influence of your product to prospective new customers and that's how part of the initial growth can happen.

However, almost paradoxically, after having the first solid customer base in place, something weird happens to most product based companies, especially as they scale up:

essentially, they stop talking to clients. Why is this happening?

Instead of having direct conversations with the customer, which is the most relevant stakeholder of all, we start introducing several proxies between the development team and the customer, which, just like the broken telephone game, will twist the concerns and expectations from both sides, and it usually ends up on having developers building the wrong thing, working in isolation from the customer, taking longer to deliver... just to learn after the fact that it was not really what was intended at all.

The problem with introducing these proxy stakeholders like Product Owners, Managers, Customer Relations, etc, is that the people in the middle are not tied directly to the product development directly, so, when translating the needs of the customer back to the development team, an obvious disconnect happens because the interface between both ends only knows about one side (the business and/ore requirements), but, is somewhat in the dark about the other side (the development team and its efforts) which makes interfacing literally impossible.

I think it would be very valuable if product based companies would bring back the practice that most likely they used originally of keeping in touch with customers directly, making them part of the feedback loop of the product development, because this is the most straightforward way of ensuring that what is being built is exactly what the customer will need, and, simultaneously, this can help shaping future efforts, so, a roadmap where the development team talks to the customers directly, will look very different of a roadmap that is developed in isolation by a product team where the only traces of customer communication come in the form of emails or messages exchanged between a product owner or a consultant and the customer themselves.

By involving developers to chat with clients directly, taking an exploratory approach and being open about flaws in the product, what's achievable on a 3-6 months horizon and by agreeing with customers on what is the best thing to build right now that adds the most value to the product, that's how you can ensure that you are delivering maximum value as a team, independently of how you work and whatever methodology you follow.

One of the best recollections I have of this is of the work done at my previous job, where I witnessed the value of this approach firsthand. We had an old product being used by a handful of clients that were brinnging in several return to the company, and, essentially, the clients wanted a re-work of the whole thing, a complete overhaul to make it better fit their own data ingestion pipelines and to improve the insights they got out of the data. Now, this was a relatively small company where the hierarchy was very, very flat, essentially, there were developers and a couple of managers who had been responsible for the creation of the product and the direction on which we wanted to take it as a company. But, one thing they never, ever lost sight of was the goal: we want to do this to make sure that we are delivering the best possible value to our clients. 

So at the time of this large rewrite effort, one of our managers jumped on a call with a few people from the customer side who were actively using the product on a very frequent basis. These calls would usually take place in a separate office area within the company so nobody would disturb the call. And, the first thing my manager did was, literally to get me and a QA colleague together with him in the same room, we brought
