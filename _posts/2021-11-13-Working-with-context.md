## Working with context

Recently, I've been thinking about the importance of working with context. What does this mean exactly? Context can mean a lot of different things to different people, so I'll try to elaborate on what I exactly mean by this and how exactly it can help you. 

In software development, we are constantly surrounded by many context-heavy tasks and bits of information that we need to process and keep in mind, and, honestly, there can be cases when this feels overwhelming, especially when you start in a new team where there are chances of the tech stack being new, the team being completely new and the business domain being new. 

When all of these things are new "at once", it's easy to be overwhelmed and feeling lost in the midst of it, because there are so many new things to load into the brain that it's just not possible to take it all in one fell swoop. But, if that's the case, then how do you adapt (and eventually thrive) in a new work environment? If you spend time simply feeling overwhelmed, then it looks like there's no time to become productive, right? 
That's absolutely right!! The first step towards unblocking yourself is to realize that you aren't going to be able to learn everything in one go.

In fact, it's normal that you're _never_ going to be able to learn everything about the business, the codebase and know everyone by their names. The first thing that you should come to terms with, is that you'll never know everything and that's fine! 

The second thing you need to know is that taking baby steps is always going to win in efficiency in the long run, compared to trying to do everything at once. This is something that you might feel that you would be able to do and handle on your own. I mean, you look back and remember how effective you were at your last job and now you can't even build your code locally? What kind of amateur hour is this?
