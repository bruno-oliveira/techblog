title: Atomic habits & Programming

I've just recently finished reading the book "[Atomic Habits"](https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits) by James Clear, and, it's a very fascinating book that touches upon the power of making tiny changes to achieve remarkable results. The main takeaway can be boiled down, in simple terms, to a simple idea: _what could you achieve if you focused on getting 1% better than yesterday, every day, for a year?_ Doing some math, we can arrive at the following two formulas that illustrate this difference clearly:

1.01^365 = 37.783..

0.99^365 = 0.0255..

The idea is that improving by 1% every day will lead you to extraordinary results, and, conversely, slacking off over time can make you really hit rock bottom in terms of your performance and achievements. This might look like a very obvious statement and that's because it is. What is really hard to realize and make happen is to _really_ put in the daily effort. Every single day. Without a fail. This can be extremely hard to do. It's easy to slack off, let life get in the way or lose motivation, but, ultimately, the real recipe for achieving success is to show up and _consistently_ put in the effort. Only then it will be possible to achieve good results. Be it with running to get in shape or coding features with your colleagues at work, there really is no magic recipe besides _showing up every day and put in the effort._ In fact, according to the book this trait of relentless consistency is what distinguishes a professional from an amateur or from someone who is not truly commited.

At our job, it's easy to show up every day, because we have a contract we signed that stipulates the hours we need to put in daily. Day after day, week after week, year after year. Besides this, our jobs, and I will now drill down specifically into programming, as this is my area of work also offer very tangible rewards in the form of nice appraisals from colleagues, nice features delivered to clients, a sense of belonging and achievement and all these factors contribute greatly for making writing code for a living almost into a habit.

Note that while I say almost here, that is a very important classifier. An habit is something one can do without thinking after having perfected it over time in such a way that it can be done almost in auto-pilot. Programming or, better put, developing and writing software is far from being classified as an habit on its own, because it's something that requires constant engagement, exploration and thinking and it's far from being of the passive or more auto-pilot nature that habits normally tend to become associated with.

However, at our jobs, we are constantly operating at several layers of "engagement", such as, attending meetings, gathering requirements, talking to clients, actually writing code, debugging issues, helping colleagues, etc.

When all of these activities are considered as a whole, a bit like looking at a mountain range from afar, the bigger picture can never be seen as something you do on auto-pilot, it requires engagement and context switching and constant focus. However, within each of these layers, there are some things we can actually make an habit out of in a way that we can reap benefits from them by using our mental capacity in the best way possible. I will touch upon the 4 laws of habit formation exposed in the book and make a paralel with some of the tasks we are faced with as developers on our daily job. The 4 laws described in the book are: _make it visible_, _make it attractive_, _make it easy_ and _make it satisfying_. Let's look at some examples based on these 4 laws and see how to apply them at a micro-level for some of the tasks we are faced with every day while we need to write software. Bear in mind that these will be simple examples that are presented to illustrate the power of these concepts as drivers for finding things that can be improved over time. As with everything, these can be made as simple or as complex as you'd like and can be adjusted to fit almost any situation.
