**Introduction**

It has been a long while since I've written here, however, that doesn't mean I've not been [actively writing](https://typeshare.co/boliveira) in other places and exploring other writing formats. Just keep writing! That has been. my motto for a while and I try to apply it to myself as much as possible.

A great deal of what I write about is actually influenced by what I read, because, when reading, I usually end up forming my own opinions and thoughts on the subject, and, 9 times out of 10, I find that with a little bit of effort in structuring, I can make a nice blog post out of it, so, here we are again.
