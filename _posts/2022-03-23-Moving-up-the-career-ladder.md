**Introduction**

It has been a long while since I've written here, however, that doesn't mean I've not been [actively writing](https://typeshare.co/boliveira) in other places and exploring other writing formats. Just keep writing! That has been. my motto for a while and I try to apply it to myself as much as possible.

A great deal of what I write about is actually influenced by what I read, because, when reading, I usually end up forming my own opinions and thoughts on the subject, and, 9 times out of 10, I find that with a little bit of effort in structuring, I can make a nice blog post out of it, so, here we are again.

The latest topic I've been interested on is on the overall career progression for software engineers, not only because I have some more experience under my belt, but also because it's a great way to _deliberately_ grow as an engineer to understand what the levels above yours are responsible for. It's not always easy to do those things retroactively, but, even knowing what they are can set you on an upwards trajectory because you can branch out of your comfort zone and speed up your own growth.

A great book tying closely with this topic is ["The Coding Career Handbook"](https://www.learninpublic.org/) by Shawn Swyx Wang. I've only now started with it, but, the first chapter related to career progression is interesting to dissect in further details: it's about how to well in your new role as a junior developer, or, in other words, becoming an _effective_ junior developer.

There is a lot covered in the book, but, some of the main points that resonated with me on which I will be elaborating upon are the following:

- asking good questions;

- adding value;

- grow your knowledge;

- rely on your team;

Note that some of these are based on the book, while others are my own.

I agree with everything I've read so far and, as an intermediate software developer, it's interesting to read this and look back at how my own progression went from becoming an effective junior to becoming an intermediate developer. All of the above aspects were crucial in fostering my growth and these are the type of things that will always serve you well no matter how far you are in your career. Simply, the way they will manifest and the scope they will have will look different at different stages of your career, but, for now, let's look at how to leverage this to become an effective junior which naturally fosters the transition to an intermediate developer.

**Asking good questions**

Asking good questions is [hard](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html), because when you're beginning your career, the amount of unknown unknowns is too high. You don't know what you don't know, and, obviously being in that position makes it inherently hard to ask good questions. 

The main reasoning behind this is that it's very easy to ask bad questions: "This doesn't work, can you help me?" it's an extremely common and yet, pretty bad question. 

There are other examples of more elaborate questions that are still terrible. A better, still terrible version of the previous question could be, for instance: "I see that my code does not compile because it can't find this Jackson library to parse some JSON, can you help me?".

The main issues with both of these questions, that generalize to what constitutes a bad question, is that they don't really showcase a deep level of engagement with the problem behind a very superficial scratch on it. 

I like to use what I call a _depth-first_ approach to put myself on a position where I can ask better questions: the main idea is that whenever I am faced with a problem that I can't immediately figure out, there will be several threads that can point out to what the real problem is and what potential solution(s) can be.
So, here's my mini-framework on how to ask better questions:

1. Fully understand the problem

The impact of this first step can't be overstated.

It's not uncommon to not get any bang for the buck when you're asking the wrong questions.
