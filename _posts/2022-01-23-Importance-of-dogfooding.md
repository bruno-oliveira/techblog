title: Dogfooding and building better products

Dogfooding is the practice of using your own products as a way to uncover potential issues and/or improvement areas for them. While it is not a new practice, there has been some recent controversy with it, especially with what has happened at DoorDash that made news when it announced it would require all of its employees — including engineers (gasp!) — to deliver food once a month. The program is an expansion of an initiative to get employees regularly testing its products. It was expanded to include three options for employees to test out the business each month. They’re referring to it as: WeDash, WeSupport and WeMerchant. WeDash is the overall program which includes “dashing,” executing actual deliveries. WeSupport entails employees shadowing a customer experience agent, and WeMerchant, which is the newest addition, entails employees shadowing merchants to better observe logistics and the experience of fulfilling orders. DoorDash encourages its employees who are going out to deliver food or shadow merchants to team up with a couple colleagues to do the job.

The goal is for DoorDash salaried employees, including the CEO, to gain a better understanding of the product and troubleshoot any observed issues that arise. The program is strongly encouraged and employees log the time into Workday to keep track.

The goal is that by letting all employees at all levels in a company really experience and use the products directly, they will be better positioned to understand what is lacking and how things can be improved in ways that using proxies like surveys, metrics tracking or written feedback simply can't convey.

Part of the problem at DoorDash arose from the fact that the company decided to put engineers in the front-lines delivering value to customers directly (by doing deliveries) at a much higher rate than the value that they are supposed to bring thanks to their much more specialized skillset (writing software).
