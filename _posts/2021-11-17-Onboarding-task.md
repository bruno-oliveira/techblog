## A New Post

One of the biggest challenges when starting a new job, both from an employee perspective and a company perspective, is deciding what is a good task to assign someone who just joined the team.
In fact, of all three companies I've worked at so far, I've experienced different approaches to the onboarding process, and, while some worked better than others, I feel that none of it was exactly what I would look for in my own ideal onboarding.

Typically, either one of these things happen:

- You are put, alone, on simply reading documentation about a framework you will be using. Just the docs, no real work happens for, who knows, maybe weeks. This doesn't click with me, because, reading docs while trapped in a _contextless void_ simply doesn't cut it. You won't absorb any real working knowledge, because you've never worked with the thing.

- You are assigned a ticket. Any ticket. A ticket that the team feels it's easy or straightforward. This is a much better approach than the previous one.
