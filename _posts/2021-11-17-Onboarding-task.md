## A New Post

One of the biggest challenges when starting a new job, both from an employee perspective and a company perspective, is deciding what is a good task to assign someone who just joined the team.
In fact, of all three companies I've worked at so far, I've experienced different approaches to the onboarding process, and, while some worked better than others, I feel that none of it was exactly what I would look for in my own ideal onboarding.

Typically, either one of these things happen:

- You are put, alone, on simply reading documentation about a framework you will be using. Just the docs, no real work happens for, who knows, maybe weeks. This doesn't click with me, because, reading docs while trapped in a _contextless void_ simply doesn't cut it. You won't absorb any real working knowledge, because you've never worked with the thing.

- You are assigned a ticket. Any ticket. A ticket that the team feels it's easy or straightforward. This is a much better approach than the previous one. Because with this, at least, you are forced to go through the standard onboarding things that are usually one-offs: what's the team's branching strategy? What is the review policy? Are there tests? And while you learn about these details, you slowly start building up context which is really valuable in the long run. However, there's a flaw in this approach too: _what the team feels it's an easy ticket, is usually riddled with bias because these folks have been with this codebase for much longer._ Or, putting it in a SCRUM parlor: a ticket that is a 5-point effort for someone in the team for a year, can be easily a sprint-wide effort for someone who was just onboarded. 
Unfortunately, since the onboarding needs to be somewhat expedite by having a concrete chunk of work in place, the team will simply act upon their own feelings of complexity, forgetting that the lack of context plays a huge role;
