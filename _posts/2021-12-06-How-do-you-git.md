Using git as a system for version control is more and more becoming the standard way of keeping your code versioned for its changes. There is probably a minority of companies that don't use it, but, most of them will, and every company does it differently. The way a company uses git (or not at all) can tell you a lot about its engineering culture and what is valued within the development teams by the leadership.
