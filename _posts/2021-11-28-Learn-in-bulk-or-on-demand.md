An interesting post on the HN Ask section, posed a question that prompted me to write this short piece:

"Which one is better - a) Read all books/blogs/... about the relevant technologies related to a project and start working b) Read books/blogs/... on need basis as you keep working on your project."

This is a really interesting question and, critically looking at it, I believe there are two sides to it: if you are working on a personal project, there is a certain approach you can take, and, if you are working at your job, probably the exploratory aspect will differ a little bit, because the environment and the tools at your disposal are also different, so, I will try to approach this interesting question from both perspectives.
