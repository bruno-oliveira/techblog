## A New Post

I follow several technical people on Twitter from all steps of the technical ladder, from juniors all the way to managers, PM, TPMs, Tech Leads, etc. I like to do this because it gives me a wider frame of reference to look at myself and see exactly where I stand in my own progression. It's critical to me that I have a wider view of different levels in the industry besides only my own, otherwise, I can become biased in my own judgment. 

I'm a mid-level developer myself and, it's also no secret that, inside the same role there are differences in both skills and expectations depending whether you're a mid-level developer promoted yesterday or if you're aiming to become a senior. Is this something that can be quantified? Can we demystify how the "unmarked steps" in the career ladder can be climbed? I'll give it my best shot. 

One of the most prolific and active people I follow is @kefimochi. She's, like myself, a mid-level developer and she recently tweeted the following:

Since I've been at mid-level for well over a year now, I think I can write a little about what I've been doing to reach the higher steps and my own views on it. 

### Different companies, different meaning 

Every company is different. This means that the business, the size of (and criticality) the development team for the success of the company will all affect what the internal career ladders will look like. So, this is the real first step in the process, in my opinion: figure out the lay of the land and understand exactly where you stand inside the development team and where the development team is, regarding the rest of the organization: is it critical for the business to keep growing or is it just "one more team"? This is important from the perspective of the stakeholders which can ultimately decide whether you're eligible for climbing the next step or not, even if indirectly. Once you've got this covered, you can start taking next steps. 

### Establishing goals and/or a clear growth path

This might sound quirky, but, I think that by doing it, you'll immediately start to differentiate yourself from the rest: is there an established framework or internal career ladder that you, as an IC, can refer to when you're planning on growing in your career? Is there a formal process in place? 
If the answer to any of these questions is no, I'd wager that you have a perfect opportunity here to start that growth: _propose that you spearhead the creation of such a framework, together with your manager._
Now, obviously this doesn't need to be super elaborate, but, even some simple guidelines for defining role and level expectations can go a long way. I personally love looking at the [Dropbox career framework](https://dropbox.github.io/dbx-career-framework/) to inspire myself on how to present my case and spot potential improvements in my own processes and maybe even your own company's framework. I suggest you have a look! Really amazing stuff there! 

### Understand your gaps from where you are versus where you want to be

Once you have a goal in mind, the next thing to do is to evaluate your current self against that goal and make sure you are completely aligned and aware of your gaps so that you can "move with intent" to close those gaps. This is easier to do between the marked steps in the ladder than it is to do between being a low tier mid level and a high tier mid level, but, it should be possible to do at any level if the goals and career paths discussed above are well-established. Let's look at an example: suppose that a criteria defining what a high level mid developer may look like is the following: "can work autonomously on large features and own them end-to-end".
Now, it's crucial to look at this critically and think for yourself if you are doing it, but that alone isn't enough. This is where things can get really tricky because knowing it for yourself is one thing, but, to present a solid case of it to your manager or tech lead, can be very different, especially because there is a big difference between what _you think_ your manager knows or how he sees your work and the way _you_ see your work yourself. This is an absolutely critical distinction to bear in mind. "What does it mean? Of course I can work autonomously, and, what, did they forget that super awesome dashboard where I had to spend 2 sprints syncing with QA and the front-end guys to really see it done to completion? I'm definitely doing this _and_ more". Our instincts are often betraying us here, especially because confirmation bias is real. We always believe we do a good job, and, usually, when confronted with some sort of reachable goal like the one stated above, we immediately tend to jump to try to find things we have done that confirm that we are effectively operating at such a level. This makes understanding the gaps between where we are and where we want to be extremely challenging, so, discussing these sorts of things with your manager but **definitely** with your peers is the best way to get a more accurate judgement of where exactly you stand. This means some of the feedback you get can sting a little: "Hey, yeah, look Bruno, you're doing great work and that last feature we shipped was great, but, don't you agree that you could have taken a bit more ownership when we had that production bug? When you prepare some tickets for the team, usually the descriptions are a bit convuluted, etc.". Right? Stuff like this is what you _must_ seek in order to truly understand the real gaps in your work preventing you from ramping up. Usually, self-assessment is enough, but, I vouch that for understanding real gaps, external confirmation is the only way to get rid of your own confirmation bias. Get this feedback!
