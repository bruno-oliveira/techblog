## A New Post

I follow several technical people on Twitter from all steps of the technical ladder, from juniors all the way to managers, PM, TPMs, Tech Leads, etc. I like to do this because it gives me a wider frame of reference to look at myself and see exactly where I stand in my own progression. It's critical to me that I have a wider view of different levels in the industry besides only my own, otherwise, I can become biased in my own judgment. 

I'm a mid-level developer myself and, it's also no secret that, inside the same role there are differences in both skills and expectations depending whether you're a mid-level developer promoted yesterday or if you're aiming to become a senior. Is this something that can be quantified? Can we demystify how the "unmarked steps" in the career ladder can be climbed? I'll give it my best shot.
