title: Setting up early career devs for success

With the market being so hot right now for senior developers and experienced applicants, it's undoubtedly a hard time to be an early-career developer in search of a new job. So, it makes it especially important for the rest of us to ensure that early-career engineers can be set up for success so that they can thrive and pass on what they've learned to the next generation of developers, keeping up the nice cycle of knowledge sharing embedding in it the new technologies and best practices that inevitably will arise.

### The world through their point of view

Everybody was once a junior, but, many of us barely remember exactly how it all started. Every person's path is different and times change very rapidly when it comes to software engineering: what was great 5 or 10 years ago might not be so applicable anymore, so, as a result, being an early-career engineer today will feel very different from being one 5 or 10 years ago. As a person with limited experience, it can be daunting to start a new job due to lack of exposure and also a feel for what you can accomplish technically. Without a baseline to measure yourself against (your past self will be the best one, but, that requires some bootstrapping first), you will inevitably end up looking around your new team and gauge its dynamics and see exactly where you fit in the middle of it.  This will only be reasonable to you because, it's your first job, you don't really have a baseline of things to look out for, so you hold on to the few datapoints you have - your new colleagues. 

They will likely have been involved longer than you with the company, the product, the people and with programming itself, so it will seem like you're falling behind before even getting started, but, the truth is, you just lack some practical experience, and, this is the time where _being set up for success_ can make or break your career both in your current company and even in general, in case things really go wrong. So, what can more experienced developers do to help with this?

_How to set up early-career people for success in your company?_ Let's see a few things we can do.

### Setting up for success: an ongoing process

Success for an early-career dev or anyone starting at a new company, can be easy to measure: did this person manage to complete the onboarding successfully and be a productive member of the team in a relatively short amount of time? Is this person happy by the end of this process? Does this person have a clear understanding of their role within their direct team and, additionally, in the organization in general?

These questions are easy enough to answer after a few months by both managers and developers, and, simultaneously, they're also a good way for evaluating, as a company, what can be improved in your process to make sure that people really are being set up for success as soon as they join a team. It's important to clarify that this should not be measured discretly and it should feel more like a continuous process that can grow and change over time as people come and go. 

As developers, we value technical expertise and formal processes that can be followed to help us reach our goals _but_ we also _need_ the time and space to explore, learn and foster our creativity within the tasks given to us.

Combining both of these worlds and wrapping it all with good and updated onboarding documentation is almost an art: it's different everywhere, it's opinionated, it depends on the size of the team and the company and it's pretty hard to get right from the get go. So, let's look at a list of points that can help streamlining this process, or, at least, guide people into trying out new things.

#### Onboarding documentation

Having an onboarding process in place is very important: in the midst of all the chaos and everythinng being new, having a central process that new people can follow can really make a big difference in how they adapt and adjust in their first few weeks, which in turn, will dictate (or not) their success over a few months.  
This doesn't even need to be very well-defined: pointers to relevant internal wiki links over Slack and having a more technical set of markdown documents in the repo, _next to the code_, can be a huge force multiplier for someone just starting out. If possible, also detail a little bit how things work in terms of testing, deploying and code reviews, and, when put all together, you will have a nice, complete package that new joiners can follow.

In addition, also ensure that new people document any additional questions that they have and have them completing and extending the documentation, improving your onboarding process while simultaneously giving them some simple tasks to build up familiarity with the codebase. Everybody wins.
