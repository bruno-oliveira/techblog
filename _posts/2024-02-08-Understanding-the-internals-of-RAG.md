In a [previous](https://dev.to/brunooliveira/basic-rag-app-with-spring-ai-docker-and-ollama-1i7j) blog post, I detailed a possible technical setup for having a solid foundation for doing RAG within the Springboot ecosystem, using docker to leverage locally downloaded LLMs and Postgres, configured with the `PGVector` extension to be able to manipulate and store embeddings and work with similarity search from a Postgres DB. If you haven't yet, go read that one, as it will greatly help with digesting this upcoming content, even if I'll try to make this as self-contained as possible.
