title: Choosing what to work on

Modern agile practices in software development are usually a synonym with well-defined chunks of work over a specific timeline, usually a 2-week sprint. What this implies is that by having a fixed timeline to work on, it also limits the amount of work that a team can deliver in that fixed period of time. So, it becomes imperative that people work on what can deliver the most impact.
However, knowing how to choose exactly what to work on can be a bit of a tricky question that can arise when using these types of practices. Immediately, several questions can arise such as:

- will I work on the thing that delivers most value in the sprint?

- will it be the most technically interesting thing?

- the most urgent thing?

- the less well-refined item that nobody wants to pick up?

All of these questions are very valid and useful to be able to answer, but, it's not always easy, especially when you also need to be in sync with other team members who all want to work on their own things
