## Empowering teams are like career accelerators

I follow several technical people whose stances on tech I can identify with in a few platforms, and, by far, [Gergely Orosz](https://www.linkedin.com/mwlite/in/GergelyOrosz) has been one of the most influential people I've decided to follow, and, I'm glad I did! As a former Uber manager his posts and insights are always extremely interesting to read. Some of the topics are geared towards senior ICs or people who are on track to become managers or who have more people responsibilities than a standard IC, but, at least recently, I've found for myself that you can always take away something valuable from such articles, even if you aren't yet at that level. 
This is a bit in-line with the Stackoverflow article about growing by doing [stretch assignments](https://stackoverflow.blog/2021/08/16/using-stretch-work-assignments-to-help-engineers-grow/).

These are things that are just a little bit above your current skills or responsibilities, but, when you do them, you end up growing much faster because you are "stretching" your abilities further in ways that you wouldn't be able to do in your current position alone.

Anyway, this was a slight deviation from the main point of this blog post, but, I think, still an important one: no matter at what level you are in your career, you can learn from people and resources that are at higher positions than you, if you know how to leverage it and what to extract from such resources and how to apply it to your current situation. 

This blog post will be inspired by a comment on a LinkedIn post originally written by Gergely! 

The main topic of today is how you can grow so much faster if you are surrounded by a great team! It's something that I had sometimes thought about before, but, for some reason, I've always ended up associating this growth with things like: tenure in the company - the longer you stay in a place, the more you can grow (we'll see later that this is rarely the case) - and always being willing to say yes to anything that lands on your plate - I'd wager this is also maybe more of a personality trait instead of a career decision, but, it's definitely something that can affect your career, so, it's important to bring it up. I have struggled a lot with this second point in the past and I still do, but, it's worthy to learn when to say no. 

Again, this really stems from my own notion of what it really meant to grow in a job in a sustainable way, and, I was still extremely junior at the time, fresh out of university and willing to prove myself, and, well, as Feynman said, "the easiest person to fool, is yourself". Basically, I had never thought exactly about how to grow in a sustainable way because I had never had the right environment for it. But, since I do have that currently, it's easier to see how much importance a good team really plays in accelerating your career. But how exactly can a great team help you supercharging your career? Let's look at some points that I observed so far:

1. **People need to care about their products and their customers**

I know that this sounds obvious, but, trust me, it really isn't. 
It's extremely common for our line of work, where the pay is good, benefits are good and work exists aplenty, to have people who treat the work as a simple process of converting some sort of effort into money. I mean, sure, that's what we all do if we think in absolutes, but, I think there is a certain attitude that can make you feel better about yourself and your work, when you really dedicate yourself to it, that can make you a great developer instead of just being in it for the money. You need to learn your craft well, put in your own efforts to [gain context]
