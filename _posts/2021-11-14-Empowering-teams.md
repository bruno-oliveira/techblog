## Empowering teams are like career accelerators

I follow several technical people whose stances on tech I can identify with in a few platforms, and, by far, [Gergely Orosz](https://www.linkedin.com/mwlite/in/GergelyOrosz) has been one of the most influential people I've decided to follow, and, I'm glad I did! As a former Uber manager his posts and insights are always extremely interesting to read. Some of the topics are geared towards senior ICs or people who are on track to become managers or who have more people responsibilities than a standard IC, but, at least recently, I've found for myself that you can always take away something valuable from such articles, even if you aren't yet at that level. 
This is a bit in-line with the Stackoverflow article about growing by doing [stretch assignments](https://stackoverflow.blog/2021/08/16/using-stretch-work-assignments-to-help-engineers-grow/).

These are things that are just a little bit above your current skills or responsibilities, but, when you do them, you end up growing much faster because you are "stretching" your abilities further in ways that you wouldn't be able to do in your current position alone.

Anyway, this was a slight deviation from the main point of this blog post, but, I think, still an important one: no matter at what level you are in your career, you can learn from people and resources that are at higher positions than you, if you know how to leverage it and what to extract from such resources and how to apply it to your current situation. 

This blog post will be inspired by a comment on a LinkedIn post originally written by Gergely! 

The main topic of today is how you can grow so much faster if you are surrounded by a great team! It's something that I had sometimes thought about before, but, for some reason, I've always ended up associating this growth with things like: tenure in the company - the longer you stay in a place, the more you can grow (we'll see later that this is rarely the case) - and always being willing to say yes to anything that lands on your plate - I'd wager this is also maybe more of a personality trait instead of a career decision, but, it's definitely something that can affect your career, so, it's important to bring it up. I have struggled a lot with this second point in the past and I still do, but, it's worthy to learn when to say no.
