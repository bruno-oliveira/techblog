## Having a deep understanding of things

Recently stumbled upon a Twitter post that went along the lines of: "how can infrastructure teams use most of the services offered by vendors like AWS without having a deeper understanding of how they are built internally?"

That got me thinking about the meaning of having a deeper understanding of the internals of something. I think this is actually different across the "infra people" and "regular developers" in the sense that infrastructure seems to be a somewhat special case of an abstraction that only (somewhat) recently has started to "bleed" into code with the recent approaches of infrastructure-as-code becoming more popular and containers becoming basically unnecessary _both_ in a local development context
